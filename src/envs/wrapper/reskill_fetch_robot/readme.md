# Environment installatoin

We use the fetch robot environment from [Reskill](https://github.com/krishanrana/reskill). Please install Reskill and be careful for the gym version, because Reskill only supports a special low version.

# Data collection
We use the same data from Reskill by downloading the [demo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yTr_6fc-sHXK_CZkm8QIRTV9VgWxKpOE). Then convert it to the data format using [convert.py](convert.py).
